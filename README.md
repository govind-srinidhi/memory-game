# memory-game
In this game, a player is presented with a number of cards. Each card has a number on one side and is blank (empty) from the other side. To start the game, the player is asked to choose the number of cards to play (4, 8 or 12). After that, they will see the cards on the screen with random numbers displayed on them and one button “Play”.

When they click the play button, cards will be flipped to the blank side. The player is then asked to click on the cards in ascending order of the numbers that are on the other side.

Example turn:

- Cards are flipped to the blank side.
- Player click on the card 10 followed by 12, 34 and 45
